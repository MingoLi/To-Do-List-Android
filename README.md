Persona 5 To-DoList
===
Try this application on your Android phone with something a bit more stylish - Persona 5 To-Do List!

Based on the main theme of in-game app that all of the Phantom Thieves use to plan their infiltrations, the Persona 5 To-Do List does everything you'd expect from an To-Do List app, such as adding, deleting, modifying tasks and setting priority. You can also write long "Note" with subject and content. Start to manage your time and become organized today!

Disclaimer: installing this app does not make you a Phantom Thief, will not give you special powers and will not force you to go to bed early every night.
